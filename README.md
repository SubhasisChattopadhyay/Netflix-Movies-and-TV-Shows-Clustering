# Netflix-Movies-and-TV-Shows-Clustering
This Dataset consists of TV shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019. The dataset is collected from Flixable which is a third party Netflix search engine. In 2018, they released an interesting report which shows that the number of TV shows has recently tripled, while the number of movies has decreased by more than 2000 titles since 2010. It will be interesting to explore what all other insights can be obtained from the same Dataset. Integrating this Dataset with other external datasets such as IMDB ratings, rotten tomatoes can also provide many interesting findings. In this project, you are required to do
